## Usage

To open the mods settings, press the **F6** key or your configured key.  
You can configure the settings key in the keybindings menu.

## Modes

### Relative

The coordinates you enter are relative to your current positions. That means if you are standing at 100 60 -30 and enter -10 5 20 your current coordinates will be -10 5 20 and 0 0 0 will have turned into -110 -55 50.

### Absolute

The coordinates you enter are relative to 0 0 0. In this case, if you are standing at 100 60 -30 and enter -10 5 20 your current coordinates will turn into 90 65 -10 and 0 0 0 will be -10 5 20.

### Custom

This mode sets your coordinates upon opening F3 to 0 0 0.

## Block Rotations

### Random Rotations

If enabled, block rotations will be offset by a specified value, else block rotations will be offset by the coordinates offsetting your F3 position.

### Reload Rotations

Generates a new random value for "Random Rotations" and reloads the world.
